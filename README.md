# machine_learning_scripts
These scripts import count/differential gene expression data, model selection, pairwise performance comparison, performance evaluation, recursive feature elimination, and cross validation using scikit-learn. The scripts have been written to analyzed and prioritize biomarkers corrosponding to severe COVID-19 outcome after performing differential gene expression analyses using bulk transcriptomics datasets.
